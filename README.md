# Aroma-Cafe 
A website for a cafe named "Aroma"☕️. This website should make you crave coffee and understand the cafes ambiance.

## The Idea behind this project 💡
The idea behind this project is every programmer loved to drink coffee, so I thought, why not make a website about an imaginary cafe with a very minimilist feel. 

## What I learned 🧠
- Heavily focused on the #design of this website to give it a minimilst/highclass feel
- Creating #transitions between pages and working with the transform property.

## How it looks 🎥
